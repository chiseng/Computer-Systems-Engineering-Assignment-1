For the process method, I used a shared memory array where each process will update a cell corresponding to the configuration of the node. nodesDP will then read from the shared memory at the end to update the cellValue accordingly.

For the thread method, there appears to be an occasional segfault when running the binary. If it occurs, please run it a few more times and it should print the values accordingly. Thanks :)
